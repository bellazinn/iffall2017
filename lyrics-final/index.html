			On your mark ready set let's go
			<br/>
			Dance floor pro I know you know
			<br/>
			I go psycho when my new joint hit
			<br/>
			Just can't sit
			<br/>
			Got to get jiggy wit it, thats it
			<br/>
			Now honey honey come ride
			<br/>
			DKNY all up in my eye
			<br/>
			You gotta Prada bag with a lot a stuff in it
			<br/>
			Give it to your friend let's spin
			<br/>
			Everybody lookin' at me
			<br/>
			Glancin' the kid
			<br/>
			Wish you nig was dancin' the jig
			<br/>
			Here with this handsome kid
			<br/>
			Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
			<br/>
			I just bite it
			<br/>
			It's for the look I don't light it
			<br/>
			Illway the amay on the anceday orflay
			<br/>
			Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
			<br/>
			Yo my cardio is infinite
			<br/>
			Ha ha
			<br/>
			Big willie style's all in it
			<br/>

			<p>
			<em>[CHORUS]</em>
			</p>

			What you want to ball with the kid
			<br/>
			Watch your step you might fall
			<br/>
			Trying to do what I did
			<br/>
			Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closa'
			<br/>
			In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
			<br/>
			No love for the haters
			<br/>
			Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
			<br/>
			See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
			<br/>
			Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
			<br/>
			I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser
			<br/>
			DJ play another
			<br/>
			From the prince of this
			<br/>
			Your highness
			<br/>
			Only bad chicks ride in my whips
			<br/>
			South to the west to the east to the north
			<br/>
			Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off
			<br/>
			Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop
			<br/>
			In the winter or the (summertime)
			<br/>
			I makes it hot
			<br/>

			<p>
			<em>[CHORUS]</em>
			</p>

			Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
			<br/>
			Who's the kid in the drop
			<br/>
			Who else Will Smith
			<br/>
			Livin' that life some consider a myth
			<br/>
			Rock from south street to one two fifth
			<br/>
			Women used to tease me
			<br/>
			Give it to me now nice and easy
			<br/>
			Since I moved up like George and Wheezey
			<br/>
			Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
			<br/>
			Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum
			<br/>
			Never see Will attackin' 'em
			<br/>
			I rather play ball with Shaq and 'em
			<br/>
			Flatten 'em
			<br/>
			Psyche
			<br/>
			Hittin' you thought I took a spill
			<br/>
			But I didn't
			<br/>
			Trust the lady of my life she hittin'
			<br/>
			Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
			<br/>
			Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
			<br/>
			You trying to flex on me
			<br/>
			Don't be silly
			
			<p>
