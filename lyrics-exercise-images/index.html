					On your mark ready set let's go

					Dance floor pro I know you know

					I go psycho when my new joint hit
					<br />
					Just can't sit
					<br />
					Gotta get jiggy wit it
					<br />
					Ooh that's it
					<br />
					Now honey honey come ride
					<br />
					DKNY all up in my eye
					<br />
					You gotta Prada bag with alotta stuff in it
					<br />
					Give it to your friend let's spin
					<br />
					Everybody lookin' at me
					<br />
					Glancin' the kid
					<br />
					Wishin' they was dancin' a jig
					<br />
					Here with this handsome kid
					<br />
					Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
					<br />
					I just bite it
					<br />
					It's for the look I don't light it
					<br />
					Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
					<br />
					Givin' up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
					<br />
					Yo my car-dee-o is Infinit-
					<br />
					Ha ha
					<br />
					Big Willie Style's all in it
					<br />
					Gettin' Jiggy Wit It
					</p>

					<strong>[Chorus:]</strong>
					<br />
					Na na na na na na na nana

					<br />
					Gettin jiggy wit it
					<br />
					<em>[Repeat 3x]</em>
					</p>
					<p class="secondcolor">
					What you wanna ball with the kid
					<br />
					Watch your step you might fall
					<br />
					Trying to do what I did
					<br />
					Mama-unh mama-unh mama come closer
					<br />
					In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, unh
					<br />
					No love for the haters, the haters
					<br />
					Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
					<br />
					See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
					<br />
					Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
					<br />
					I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser
					<br />
					DJ play another
					<br />
					From the prince of this
					<br />
					Your highness
					<br />
					Only mad chicks ride in my whips
					<br />
					South to the west to the east to the north
					<br />
					Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off
					<br />
					Ah yes yes y'all ya don't stop
					<br />
					In the winter or the (summertime)
					<br />
					I makes it hot
					<br />
					Gettin jiggy wit 'em
					</p>
					<p class="font-size colortext uppercase"><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
					<p class="thirdcolor">
					Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
					<br />
					Who's the kid in the drop
					<br />
					Who else Will Smith
					<br />
					Livin' that life some consider a myth
					<br />
					Rock from south street to one two fifth
					<br />
					Women used to tease me
					<br />
					Give it to me now nice and easy
					<br />
					Since I moved up like George and Wheezy
					<br />
					Cream to the maximum I be askin' 'em
					<br />
					Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum
					<br />
					Never see Will attackin' 'em
					<br />
					Rather play ball with Shaq and um,
					<br />
					Flatten 'em
					<br />
					Psyche
					<br />
					Kiddin'
					<br />
					You thought I took a spill
					<br />
					But I didn't
					<br />
					Trust the lady of my life she hittin'
					<br />
					Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
					<br />
					Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
					<br />
					You trying to flex on me
					<br />
					Don't be silly
					<br />
					Getting jiggy wit it
					<br />
					</p>
					<p class="font-size colortext uppercase">
					<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
