		<ol>
		<li>One thing I hope to learn in this class is the basics of webdesign. I would like to be able to understand the language, and communicate with other people to be able to help wat I am imagining come to life. </li>
		<li>I think that this will be completely different, because there is another layer of complication that goes with it. You probably have to have some sort of plan of what you want the site to look like before you start to try and code it. </li>
		<li><a href="http://fall2017.wudesign.me/assignments.php">The website for this class! The design is effective because you are not confused about how to operate the website.</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN's website communicates effectively because the reader is able to see a lot of important information at the same time without being overwhelmed. The user can then interact with the information that catches their eye effectively. </a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.behance.net/">I think that Behance works well because you are able to easily search and view other artist's work.</a></li>
