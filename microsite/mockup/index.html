<p>Notes: <br/> Further information will be added through the end of his reign and his impact on the world now. <br/> Wasn't sure what you were looking for typographically, but thought a more traditional serif typeface for the headings would make sense, then a sans serif for the body text for readability.</p>
<p>Questions: <br/> Would you still be interested in doing the illustrations yourself? <br/> I could try physically collaging the images against real paper for a less digital look, then scanning the images in as a background image. </p>
